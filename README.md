# credit-card-customer-analysis-mysql-powerbi

## Project Overview
This project analyzes credit card customer and transaction data to understand revenue trends, customer behavior, and portfolio performance.  
The data was stored in a MySQL database, analyzed using SQL queries, and visualized in Power BI for reporting and business analysis.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- MySQL  
- SQL  
- Power BI  
- CSV files  

---

## Data Description
The analysis is based on two datasets:
- cc_add.csv – Credit card transaction data including transaction amount, interest, card type, and date  
- cust_add.csv – Customer-level information such as gender and state  

Both datasets were loaded into MySQL tables and used for analysis.

---

## SQL Analysis
SQL queries were used to:
- Calculate revenue, interest, and transaction amounts  
- Perform Week-over-Week (WoW) and Year-to-Date (YTD) analysis  
- Analyze customer count and spending patterns  
- Evaluate performance by card type, gender, and state  
- Prepare aggregated data for Power BI reporting  

---

## Power BI Dashboard
Power BI is connected directly to the MySQL database.  
The dashboard is used to track key metrics and monitor performance using interactive visuals and filters.

## Business Insights

### Week-over-Week (WoW)
- Revenue increased by 28.8 percent  
- Total transaction amount and transaction count increased compared to the previous week  
- Customer count also increased week over week  

### Year-to-Date (YTD)
- Overall revenue is 57M  
- Total interest is 8M  
- Total transaction amount is 46M  
- Male customers contribute 31M in revenue, while female customers contribute 26M  
- Blue and Silver credit cards contribute to 93 percent of total transactions  
- TX, NY, and CA contribute to 68 percent of overall revenue  
- Overall activation rate is 57.5 percent  
- Overall delinquent rate is 6.06 percent

## Dashboard Features
- KPI cards for revenue, interest, transaction amount, and customer count  
- Trend charts for WoW and YTD analysis  
- Breakdown by card type, gender, and state  
- Filters for interactive analysis

## Conclusion
This project represents a practical analytics use case where credit card transaction and customer data is analyzed using SQL and presented through Power BI dashboards.  
The focus is on accurate reporting, trend analysis, and supporting business understanding.
